    "# YouTube Video First Minute Extraction Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook contains functionality for extracting the first minute of audio from YouTube videos. The pipeline processes MP4 files and converts them to MP3 format, keeping track of processed files to avoid duplicate work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- Extracts first 60 seconds of audio from MP4 videos\n",
    "- Converts video to MP3 format using FFmpeg\n",
    "- Maintains processing logs to track completed files\n",
    "- Includes utilities for:\n",
    "  - Finding MP4 files in directories\n",
    "  - Processing file management\n",
    "  - Log concatenation and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n"

    "### Usage\n",
    "The pipeline processes MP4 files from a specified input directory, extracts the first minute of audio, and saves them as MP3 files in an output directory. It maintains a log of processed files to enable resumption of interrupted processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration\n",
    "- `INPUT_FOLDER`: Source directory containing MP4 files\n",
    "- `OUTPUT_FOLDER`: Destination directory for processed MP3 files\n",
    "- `LOG_FILE`: File tracking processed videos\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Tools\n",
    "Includes utilities for:\n",
    "- Log file analysis and concatenation\n",
    "- File extension detection\n",
    "- Video processing status verification"
